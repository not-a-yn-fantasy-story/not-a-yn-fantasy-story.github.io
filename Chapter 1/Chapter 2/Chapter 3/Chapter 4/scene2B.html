		You quickly gather the few personal items that you have into one bag preparing to leave in the middle of the night.

		After dinner, you return to your room to wait.

		Around midnight, you grab your bag and quietly open the door. You scan the hallway. Since it is empty, you approach the stairs. You run into Jerry at the bottom. He is surprised to see you.

		Jerry: The best way out of here is to leave through the back. Pass through the garden and then straight through the woods until you get to the main road. Tim will meet you there in his truck. You're going to have to climb over the fence to get to the road though. Can you do that?
