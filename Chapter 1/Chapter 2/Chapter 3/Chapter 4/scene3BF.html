		You quickly gather the few personal items that you have into one bag preparing to leave in the middle of the night.

		After dinner, you return to your room to wait.
		<br>
		Around midnight, you grab your bag and quietly open the door. You scan the hallway. Since it is empty, you approach the stairs.
		<br>
		Once you get to the first floor, you go straight to the library.
		<br>
		You freeze in the doorway when you find Hermina reading in there.
