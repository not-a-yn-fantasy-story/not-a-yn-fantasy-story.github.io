		It's been a couple of months since your arrival. While Jake gives you a lot of work to do throughout the week, you've had some fun getting to know a few of your housemates.
		<br>
		One day, you're mopping in the kitchen when Jake calls everyone into the living room to deliver some news.

		Jake: Hello, everyone. I wanted to have you all here so I can tell everyone at once. As you all know there has been some conflict between us Musers and the Tokers for a while now. I know they're annoying as hell, but I think it's time we extend an olive branch to the Tokers since they've become even more of a hindrance to our business lately. You all know I'm not just an international popstar and mafia boss. I'm also a businessman.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Hermina: You only tell us four times a day.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Tim: What is the point of calling this meeting exactly, Jake?
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jimothee: Yeah, can you get on with it? I have to design your performance outfits for your next tour.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jake: Then, shut up so I can tell you... I've invited Chad Hoodson and the Tokers to join us here for a small dinner gathering-party-thing to talk about working together instead of against each other. We'll have it tomorrow night.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Damien: That sounds like a stupid idea.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jake: That's because it was Jerry's.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Hermina: Well, I think it's a great idea, Jerry.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jake: Well, we both came up with it. Anyway, y/n will be cooking all of the food and setting everything up for the gathering. That's it. I have to get back to my song writing.

		You: Jimothee, I thought you were a bot. Shouldn't you like know everything?

		<p>
		Jimothee: I'm a STYLE bot. I know everything related to fashion, not everything related to everything.
		</p>
		<br>

		</p>
		<br>

		<br>
		<p>
		Jimothee: Most people know and refer to Chad as 'Big Hoody'
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		You: He's Big Hoody? The Toker mafia boss? I was expecting someone older and maybe uglier.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Hermina: Yeah, you haven't known him since before he was the leader, before he was a murderous bastard.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		You: I take it you're not a fan.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jimothee: Of course she's not. I'm not even a fan and I don't even have the same emotional capacity.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		You: Okay. Okay. Then, which one is Jangcook?
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Hermina: He is Chad's right hand man. He's the one with the mask on. He never takes it off.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		Jimothee: He never talks either.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
		You: Oh... He has really nice thighs.
